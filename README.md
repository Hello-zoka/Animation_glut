Hello!
This if very useful glut implementation of drawing objects, which can be used in many different tasks.
For example, you can find here two projects:
  1) Table with the recoloring ball(press wasd-buttons to move)
  2) A lot of random glut-objects
You can press "f"-button for full-screen mod, "p"-button to pause, esc - to exit
