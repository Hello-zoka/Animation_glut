# Animation

Hello!
This is a useful implementation of working with a dynamic scene in a glut with support for user interaction, which can be used in many different tasks. Based on this architecture, several projects were implemented to work with image processing on GPU. 

Users can press do this standard actions:
1. Press `f` button to open the window in full-screen mode
2. Press  `esc` button to close the window and end program
3. Press `p` button to pause/play animation

To show basics abilities of this code you can see these two projects:
1) A ball that hits the chessboard and repaints its cells in different colors.
You can move the ball, using `wasd` buttons
